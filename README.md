# Hardcore Oxygen Not Inluded

Here is my hard settings and mods for Oxygen Not Included. This lead to a very much harder game. You can adapt them to your starting asteroid and your game knowledge as you wish. The goal for me doing this was to push the game to something more exigent, where each detail should be taken into account to make the colony survive.

# Mindset
For the Quality of Life (QoL) mods and the Cosmetics one, they have no influence on the gameplay so you can do as you please, I'm juste sharing mines.

For the others, we're searching for challenges, for complexity that push further the variables to keep in mind. The goal is not to push micro management, it's really to have more things to think about. For example: adding exteriors or random constraints pushing for adaptability. Accept imperfections that will be delt with more layers on a system. Avoid simplifications. Pushing for better stocks gestion and interdependences between systems is also a good way to make the game more challenging.

Each mod added need to be questionned by: can I do that differently ? What's the impact of this new way ?

# Personnale rules
These rules are not enforced by a mod but we'll follow them to get a better challenge. If a mod can implement one restriction, don't hesitate to use it.

Printing Pod in game: When opening the new duplicant interface of the printing pod, we'll be forced to print the first duplicant on the left. This way, we can only determine when you are ready for a new dup but not choose what's given to you. You'll play with what the game gives you.

Saving: no manual saving, the only one being the auto saves. You can adapt it but the rule mindset here is really to avoid save scumming. Consider each save as you only one meaning if you have a save of day 25 and 50, you can only use the one of day 50. 

No infinit storage. No infinit garbage for liquids, solids or gas. No dump to space to delete gas. Dumping solids on the ground is okay as it'll come with a decor malus. 

No design copy: you can't copy a design from the web or from a sandbox. The goal here is to craft a system from scratch  with its imperfections (so, with the need of counter mesures in case something goes wrong) and assuming it could not work as expected and you'll need improvements and fixes over time.
But you have access to any resource that helps you understand how the game works, like wikis. 

Anti entropy nullifier: usage not permitted. 

Neural vaccillator: usage not permitted 

Ruines: no usage and no destruction possible. This will force you to play with the dead zones created and you won't be able to get resources from the ruins.

Gases insulation : Everything is allowed excepted for putting several doors in a row to get a perfect insulation (like 3 or 4 doors). All other ways (water lock, gas lock, vaccum doorway, Pump sas, etc.) are allowed as each one have its advantages and drawbacks, none being perfect.

Thermic insulation : airlock, waterlock, double lock: allowed, as said for gases insulation.

## Game mecanics with big impact
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1838445101 DGSM - Duplicants Generation Settings Manager // by @Ony üëæ: Settings:
  - Check "Unlock all duplicants personalities for starting", "Count in generated by Positive traits points", "Count in generated by Negative traits points"
  - Uncheck: "Print only Bionic Duplicants", "Print only Living Duplicants", "Enable for Printing Pod", 'Enable Printing POD re-roll", "No positive trait", "No negative trait", ""Fixed amount of positive traits", "Fixed amount of negative traits", "Fixed interests amount", "Redistribute interests points".
  - Duplicant count for Start = 3
  - Print only care packages when have alive Duplicants count: 7000
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2936854563 Mineralizer: this new building is balanced. Usage: waterweeds culture without having a geyser for it but costing power and salt that's not easy to get.
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3375382664: Duplicants Lifecycle: this iq adding a lot to the game depending on how you configre it, moreover because you don't choose your dup. An interesting setting is to have short youth time, and variable end lifetime with attributes malus, meaning you should handle your old incapacited dups. 
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2558069681 Chemical Burns: Will drastically change the way you open new spaces.  
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1910961538 Aquatique Farm: adding an option with its pros and cons. This could speedup your farms setup but you'll need to deal with the water depletion around the time. So early game but only as a transition. 
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1907824546 Butcher and Fishing Station: without this mod we have two options: building an automated killing system doing it for free or using dup time with no space impact. This mod add a solution between these two but consuming power, a bit of space and dup labor. Settings: extra meat 0%. 
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967059775 More Logic Ports: add automations adding more options without simplifying it.
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618339179: Freezer: Settings: 600W, passiv conso 240W, capacity 100kg. The goal is to have a durable storage but rapidly consuming a lot of space and power if quantities are important.
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3235885361 Diet variety: This mod have no settings for dynamic evolution but I encourage you to make harder settings with cycles increasing. Startup settings: MinFoodTypesRequired = 3, MaxMealsCounted = 7, MoralePerFoodType= 1. 
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2693850829 Block Decor Effects Behind Walls: Settings: disable the option for not blocking malus on buimding that cannot be placed in tiles. 
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1872105871: Drywall Hides Pipes
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1892161928 Decor Reimagined: It'll push you to handle your resources surplus and to create big moral bonus at the beginning of your game. Settings: hardcore mod.
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1911357229: Diseases Restored: Interdiction to use the UV Cleaner as chlorine is already doing the job. This mod adds a lot of complexity. 
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2627657947: Diseases Expanded. The goal here is to add diseases that are not horrible to play but that adds complexity. Settings: 
  - Enable: Infect Raw Meat Drops With Germs, Auto detect Related Mods, Enable Medical Research Points, Mutating virus, Alien Goo.
  - Disable: Frequent Virus and Nanorobots Updates, Medical Nano Robots, Moo flux, Bog Insects
  - Interdiction to use the Scanner that removes the radiations of the asteroid.
  - Severity: everything to 1 except Forst Pox to 1.25 and Alien Goo at 0.5
-  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042467105: Darkness Not Excluded. A tremendous change to your game. Do not use easy cheats that breaks the immersion like using priority screen to search the location of important stuff.
